# Expo Camera Errors on Android

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo Camera API on Android devices.  The problem manifests as the `Camera` component being undefined or inaccessible, preventing the capture of images or videos. This can stem from permission problems, incorrect component configuration, or incompatibility with specific Android versions or hardware.

## Problem

The primary issue is the inability to access the camera functionality. The error messages vary, but generally point to the `Camera` component not being properly initialized or available.  The sample code shows a common scenario resulting in this error.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing permissions, ensuring correct component usage, and potentially addressing device-specific issues. The corrected code provides a more robust implementation addressing these potential issues.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. `expo install expo-camera`
3. Run `expo start`
