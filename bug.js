This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component in conjunction with certain Android devices or configurations.  The root cause often lies in permission issues, incorrect configuration within the `Camera` component, or incompatibility with the device's camera hardware or software.  Specifically, you might see an error similar to `Camera is not defined`, `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'camera.current.takePicture')` or similar variations indicating that the camera object is not accessible.
